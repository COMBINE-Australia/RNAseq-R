# Introduction and data import

Measuring gene expression on a genome-wide scale has become common practice over the last two decades or so, with microarrays predominantly used pre-2008. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology in 2008, an increasing number of scientists use this technology to measure and understand changes in gene expression in often complex systems. As sequencing costs have decreased, using RNA-Seq to simultaneously measure the expression of tens of thousands of genes for multiple samples has never been easier. The cost of these experiments has now moved from generating the data to storing and analysing it.

There are many steps involved in analysing an RNA-Seq experiment. Analysing an RNAseq experiment begins with sequencing reads. These are aligned to a reference genome, then the number of reads mapped to each gene can be counted. This results in a table of counts, which is what we perform statistical analyses on in R. While mapping and counting are important and necessary tasks, today we will be starting from the count data and getting stuck into analysis.

First, let's load all the packages we will need to analyse the data.

## Mouse mammary gland dataset

The data for this tutorial comes from a Nature Cell Biology paper, [*EGF-mediated induction of Mcl-1 at the switch to lactation is essential for alveolar cell survival*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472) [@Fu2015]. Both the raw data (sequence reads) and processed data (counts) can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) under accession number [GSE60450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60450).

This study examines the expression profiles of basal stem-cell enriched cells (B) and committed luminal cells (L) in the mammary gland of virgin, pregnant and lactating mice. Six groups are present, with one for each combination of cell type and mouse status. Each group contains two biological replicates.
We will first use the counts file as a starting point for our analysis. This data has already been aligned to the mouse genome. The command line tool featureCounts [@Liao2014] was used to count reads mapped to mouse genes from Refseq annotation (see the [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25730472) for details).

## Reading in the data

*Set up an RStudio project specifying the directory where you have saved the `/data` directory*.
Download and read in the data.

```{r}
# Read the data into R
seqdata <- read.delim("data/GSE60450_Lactation-GenewiseCounts.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Read the sample information into R
sampleinfo <- read.delim("data/SampleInfo.txt")
```

Let's take a look at the data. You can use the `head` command to see the first 6 lines. The `dim` command will tell you how many rows and columns the data frame has.

```{r}
head(seqdata)
dim(seqdata)
```

The `seqdata` object contains information about genes (one gene per row), the first column has the Entrez gene id, the second has the gene length and the remaining columns contain information about the number of reads aligning to the gene in each experimental sample. There are two replicates for each cell type and time point (detailed sample info can be found in file "GSE60450_series_matrix.txt" from the [GEO website](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE60450)). The sampleinfo file contains basic information about the samples that we will need for the analysis today.

```{r}
sampleinfo
```

We will be manipulating and reformatting the counts matrix into a suitable format for downstream analysis. The first two columns in the `seqdata` dataframe contain annotation information. We need to make a new matrix containing only the counts, but we can store the gene identifiers (the `EntrezGeneID` column) as rownames. We will add more annotation information about each gene later on in the workshop.

## Format the data

Let's create a new data object, `countdata`, that contains only the counts for the 12 samples.  

```{r}
# Remove first two columns from seqdata
countdata <- seqdata[,-(1:2)]
# Look at the output
head(countdata)

# Store EntrezGeneID as rownames
rownames(countdata) <- seqdata[,1]
```

Take a look at the output

```{r}
head(countdata)
```

Now take a look at the column names

```{r}
colnames(countdata)
```

These are the sample names which are pretty long so we'll shorten these to contain only the relevant information about each sample. We will use the `substr` command to extract the first 7 characters and use these as the colnames.

```{r}
# using substr, you extract the characters starting at position 1 and stopping at position 7 of the colnames
colnames(countdata) <- substr(colnames(countdata),start=1,stop=7)
```

Take a look at the output

```{r}
head(countdata)
```

Note that the column names are now the same as `SampleName` in the `sampleinfo` file. This is good because it means our sample information in `sampleinfo` is in the same order as the columns in `countdata`.

```{r}
table(colnames(countdata)==sampleinfo$SampleName)
```


# Filtering lowly expressed genes

Genes with very low counts across all libraries provide little evidence for differential expression and they interfere with some of the statistical approximations that are used later in the pipeline. They also add to the multiple testing burden when estimating false discovery rates, reducing power to detect differentially expressed genes. These genes should be filtered out prior to further analysis.

There are a few ways to filter out lowly expressed genes. When there are biological replicates in each group, in this case we have a sample size of 2 in each group, we favour filtering on a minimum counts per million threshold present in at least 2 samples. Two represents the smallest sample size for each group in our experiment. In this dataset, we choose to retain genes if they are expressed at a counts-per-million (CPM) above 0.5 in at least two samples.

We'll use the `cpm` function from the *edgeR* library [@robinson2010edgeR] to generate the CPM values and then filter. Note that by converting to CPMs we are normalising for the different sequencing depths for each sample.

```{r}
# Obtain CPMs
myCPM <- cpm(countdata)
# Have a look at the output
head(myCPM)

# Which values in myCPM are greater than 0.5?
thresh <- myCPM > 0.5
# This produces a logical matrix with TRUEs and FALSEs
head(thresh)

# Summary of how many TRUEs there are in each row
# There are 11433 genes that have TRUEs in all 12 samples.
table(rowSums(thresh))

# we would like to keep genes that have at least 2 TRUES in each row of thresh
keep <- rowSums(thresh) >= 2
# Subset the rows of countdata to keep the more highly expressed genes
counts.keep <- countdata[keep,]
summary(keep)
dim(counts.keep)
```

A CPM of 0.5 is used as it corresponds to a count of 10-15 for the library sizes in this data set. If the count is any smaller, it is considered to be very low, indicating that the associated gene is not expressed in that sample. A requirement for expression in two or more libraries is used as each group contains two replicates. This ensures that a gene will be retained if it is only expressed in one group. Smaller CPM thresholds are usually appropriate for larger libraries. As a general rule, a good threshold can be chosen by identifying the CPM that corresponds to a count of 10, which in this case is about 0.5. You should filter with CPMs rather than filtering on the counts directly, as the latter does not account for differences in library sizes between samples.

```{r cpms-vs-counts}
# Let's have a look and see whether our threshold of 0.5 does indeed correspond to a count of about 10-15
# We will look at the first sample
plot(myCPM[,1],countdata[,1])
# Let us limit the x and y-axis so we can actually look to see what is happening at the smaller counts
plot(myCPM[,1],countdata[,1],ylim=c(0,50),xlim=c(0,3))
# Add a vertical line at 0.5 CPM
abline(v=0.5)
```

**Solution**
```{r cpms-vs-counts-solution, echo=FALSE}
plot(myCPM[,2],countdata[,2],ylim=c(0,50),xlim=c(0,3))
abline(v=0.5,col=4)
abline(h=10,col=4)
```
Note: When in doubt, a threshold of 1 CPM in at least *minimum* group sample size is a good rule of thumb.

## Convert counts to DGEList object

Next we'll create a `DGEList` object. This is an object used by *edgeR* to store count data. It has a number of slots for storing various parameters about the data.

```{r}
y <- DGEList(counts.keep)
# have a look at y
y
# See what slots are stored in y
names(y)
# Library size information is stored in the samples slot
y$samples
```

# Quality control

Now that we have got rid of the lowly expressed genes and have our counts stored in a `DGEList` object, we can look at a few different plots to check that the data is good quality, and that the samples are as we would expect.

## Library size and distribution plots

First, we can check how many reads we have for each sample in the `y`.

```{r}
y$samples$lib.size
```

We can also plot the library sizes as a barplot to see whether there are any major discrepancies between the samples more easily.

```{r barplot}
# The names argument tells the barplot to use the sample names on the x-axis
# The las argument rotates the axis names
barplot(y$samples$lib.size,names=colnames(y),las=2)
# Add a title to the plot
title("Barplot of library sizes")
```

Count data is not normally distributed, so if we want to examine the distributions of the raw counts we need to log the counts. Next we'll use box plots to check the distribution of the read counts on the log2 scale. We can use the `cpm` function to get log2 counts per million, which are corrected for the different library sizes. The `cpm` function also adds a small offset to avoid taking log of zero.  

```{r boxplots}
# Get log2 counts per million
logcounts <- cpm(y,log=TRUE)
# Check distributions of samples using boxplots
boxplot(logcounts, xlab="", ylab="Log2 counts per million",las=2)
# Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median logCPM
abline(h=median(logcounts),col="blue")
title("Boxplots of logCPMs (unnormalised)")
```

From the boxplots we see that overall the density distributions of raw log-intensities are not identical but still not very different. If a sample is really far above or below the blue horizontal line we may need to investigate that sample further.

## Multidimensional scaling plots

By far, one of the most important plots we make when we analyse RNA-Seq data are MDSplots. An MDSplot is a visualisation of a principle components analysis, which determines the greatest sources of variation in the data. A principle components analysis is an example of an unsupervised analysis, where we don't need to specify the groups. If your experiment is well controlled and has worked well, what we hope to see is that the greatest sources of variation in the data are the treatments/groups we are interested in. It is also an incredibly useful tool for quality control and checking for outliers. We can use the `plotMDS` function to create the MDS plot.

```{r MDSplot}
plotMDS(y)
```

It is a bit difficult to see exactly what is going on with the default plot, although we do see samples grouping together in pairs. To make this plot more informative, we can colour the samples according to the grouping information. We can also change the labels, or instead of labels we can have points.

```{r MDSplots-colours, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# We specify the option to let us plot two plots side-by-sde
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# Let's set up colour schemes for CellType
# How many cell types and in what order are they stored?
levels(sampleinfo$CellType)
## Let's choose purple for basal and orange for luminal
col.cell <- c("purple","orange")[sampleinfo$CellType]
data.frame(sampleinfo$CellType,col.cell)

# Redo the MDS with cell type colouring
plotMDS(y,col=col.cell)
# Let's add a legend to the plot so we know which colours correspond to which cell type
legend("topleft",fill=c("purple","orange"),legend=levels(sampleinfo$CellType))
# Add a title
title("Cell type")

# Similarly for status
levels(sampleinfo$Status)
col.status <- c("blue","red","dark green")[sampleinfo$Status]
col.status
plotMDS(y,col=col.status)
legend("topleft",fill=c("blue","red","dark green"),legend=levels(sampleinfo$Status),cex=0.8)
title("Status")
```

> ### Discussion {.challenge}
>
> Look at the MDS plot coloured by cell type.
> Is there something strange going on with the samples?
> Identify the two samples that don't appear to be in the right place.

```{r}
# There is a sample info corrected file in your data directory
# Old sampleinfo
sampleinfo
# I'm going to write over the sampleinfo object with the corrected sample info
sampleinfo <- read.delim("data/SampleInfo_Corrected.txt")
sampleinfo
```

```{r MDSplot-corrected, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# Redo the MDSplot with corrected information
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
col.cell <- c("purple","orange")[sampleinfo$CellType]
col.status <- c("blue","red","dark green")[sampleinfo$Status]
plotMDS(y,col=col.cell)
legend("topleft",fill=c("purple","orange"),legend=levels(sampleinfo$CellType))
title("Cell type")
plotMDS(y,col=col.status)
legend("topleft",fill=c("blue","red","dark green"),legend=levels(sampleinfo$Status),cex=0.8)
title("Status")
```

**Solution**
```{r MDSplot-nicer, echo=FALSE}
# Solution to 3
#I'm getting some nicer colours from brewer pal, using the "Dark2" palette.
cols <- brewer.pal(3,"Dark2")
cols
char.celltype <- c(1,4)[sampleinfo$CellType]
col.status <- cols[factor(sampleinfo$Status)]
plotMDS(y,col=col.status,pch=char.celltype,cex=2)
legend("topleft",legend=levels(sampleinfo$Status),col=cols,pch=16)
legend("bottom",legend=levels(sampleinfo$CellType),pch=c(1,4))
```


The distance between each pair of samples in the MDS plot is calculated as the leading fold change, defined as the root-mean-square of the largest 500 log2-fold changes between that pair of samples. Replicate samples from the same group cluster together in the plot, while samples from different groups form separate clusters. This indicates that the differences between groups are larger than those within groups, i.e., differential expression is greater than the variance and can be detected. In the MDS plot, the distance between basal samples on the left and luminal cells on the right is about 6 units, corresponding to a leading fold change of about 64-fold (2^6 = 64) between basal and luminal. The expression differences between virgin, pregnant and lactating are greater for luminal cells than for basal.

Notes

* The MDS plot can be simply generated with `plotMDS(y)`. The additional code is purely for aesthetics, to improve the visualization of the groups.
* Clustering in the MDS plot can be used to motivate changes to the design matrix in light of potential batch effects. For example, imagine that the first replicate of each group was prepared at a separate time from the second replicate. If the MDS plot showed separation of samples by time, it might be worthwhile including time in the down stream analysis to account for the time-based effect.

`plotMDS` plots the first two dimensions as a default, however you can plot higher dimensions using the `dim` argument.

```{r MDSplot-dims3vs4}
# Dimension 3 appears to separate pregnant samples from the rest. Dim4?
plotMDS(y,dim=c(3,4),col=col.status,pch=char.celltype,cex=2)
legend("topright",legend=levels(sampleinfo$Status),col=cols,pch=16)
legend("bottomright",legend=levels(sampleinfo$CellType),pch=c(1,4))
```


Another alternative is to generate an interactive MDS plot using the *Glimma* package. This allows the user to interactively explore the different dimensions.

```{r}
labels <- paste(sampleinfo$SampleName, sampleinfo$CellType, sampleinfo$Status)
group <- paste(sampleinfo$CellType,sampleinfo$Status,sep=".")
group <- factor(group)
glMDSPlot(y, labels=labels, groups=group, folder="mds")
```

*Glimma* was created to make interactive versions of some of the popular plots from the *limma* package. At present it can be used to obtain MDS plots and mean-difference (MD) plots, which will be covered later. The output of `glMDSPlot` is an html page (/mds/MDS-Plot.html) that shows the MDS plot on the left, and the amount of variation explained by each dimension in a barplot on the right. The user can hover over points to find out sample information, and switch between successive dimensions in the MDS plot by clicking on the bars in the barplot. The default MDS plots shows dimensions 1 and 2.

## Hierarchical clustering with heatmaps

An alternative to `plotMDS` for examining relationships between samples is using hierarchical clustering. Heatmaps are a nice visualisation to examine hierarchical clustering of your samples. We can do this using the `heatmap.2` function from the *gplots* package. In this example `heatmap.2` calculates a matrix of euclidean distances from the logCPM (`logcounts` object) for the 500 most variable genes. (Note this has more complicated code than plotting principle components using `plotMDS`.)

The *RColorBrewer* package has nicer colour schemes, accessed using the `brewer.pal` function. "RdYlBu" is a common choice, and "Spectral" is also nice.

Note:The `png` function will create a png file to save the plots created straight after, and will close this file when `dev.off()` is called. To see your plots interactively, simply omit those two lines.

Let's select data for the 500 most variable genes and plot the heatmap

```{r heatmap}
# We estimate the variance for each row in the logcounts matrix
var_genes <- apply(logcounts, 1, var)
head(var_genes)
# Get the gene names for the top 500 most variable genes
select_var <- names(sort(var_genes, decreasing=TRUE))[1:500]
head(select_var)
# Subset logcounts matrix
highly_variable_lcpm <- logcounts[select_var,]
dim(highly_variable_lcpm)
head(highly_variable_lcpm)

## Get some nicer colours
mypalette <- brewer.pal(11,"RdYlBu")
morecols <- colorRampPalette(mypalette)
# Set up colour vector for celltype variable
col.cell <- c("purple","orange")[sampleinfo$CellType]

# Plot the heatmap
heatmap.2(highly_variable_lcpm,col=rev(morecols(50)),trace="none", main="Top 500 most variable genes across samples",ColSideColors=col.cell,scale="row")

# Save the heatmap
png(file="High_var_genes.heatmap.png")
heatmap.2(highly_variable_lcpm,col=rev(morecols(50)),trace="none", main="Top 500 most variable genes across samples",ColSideColors=col.cell,scale="row")
dev.off()
```

# Normalisation for composition bias

TMM normalization is performed to eliminate composition biases between libraries [@robinson2010tmm]. This generates a set of normalization factors, where the product of these factors and the library sizes defines the effective library size. The `calcNormFactors` function calculates the normalization factors between libraries. TMM normalisation (and most scaling normalisation methods) scale relative to one sample.

```{r}
# Apply normalisation to DGEList object
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
```

This will update the normalisation factors in the `DGEList` object (their default values are 1). Take a look at the normalisation factors for these samples.

```{r}
y$samples
```

The normalization factors multiply to unity across all libraries. A normalization factor below one indicates that the library size will be scaled down, as there is more suppression (i.e., composition bias) in that library relative to the other libraries. This is also equivalent to scaling the counts upwards in that sample. Conversely, a factor above one scales up the library size and is equivalent to downscaling the counts.

The last two samples have much smaller normalisation factors, and MCL1.LA and MCL1.LB have the largest. If we plot mean difference plots using the `plotMD` function for these samples, we should be able to see the composition bias problem. We will use the `logcounts`, which have been normalised for library size, but not for composition bias.

```{r MDplots-before-TMM, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(logcounts,column = 7)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
plotMD(logcounts,column = 11)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
```

The mean-difference plots show average expression (mean: x-axis) against log-fold-changes (difference: y-axis).
Because our `DGEList` object contains the normalisation factors, if we redo these plots using `y`, we should see the composition bias problem has been solved.

```{r MDplots-after-TMM, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(y,column = 7)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
plotMD(y,column = 11)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
```

> #### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> Plot the biased and unbiased MD plots side by side for the same sample to see the before and after TMM normalisation effect.
>

**Solution**
```{r MDplots-solution, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(logcounts,column = 11)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
plotMD(y,column = 11)
abline(h=0,col="grey")
```

**We need to save a few data objects to use for Day 2 so we don't have to rerun everything**

```{r}
# save(group,y,logcounts,sampleinfo,file="day1objects.Rdata")
```


# Differential expression with limma-voom

Now that we are happy that we have normalised the data and that the quality looks good, we can continue to testing for differentially expressed genes. There are a number of packages to analyse RNA-Seq data. The *limma* package [@Ritchie2015] (since version 3.16.0) offers the `voom` function, which transforms the read counts into logCPMs while taking into account the mean-variance relationship in the data [@Law2014]. After vooming, users can apply a linear model to the voom transformed data to test for differentially expressed genes, using standard *limma* commands.

**Load the objects into the workspace that we created yesterday**
```{r}
# load("day1objects.Rdata")
# objects()
```


## Create the design matrix

First we need to create a design matrix for the groups (see the excellent [limma user guide](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf) for more information on design matrices). There are many different ways to set up your design matrix, and it is dictated by what comparisons you would like to test. We will follow the set-up from pg 43 of the limma vignette ("Interaction models: 2X2 factorial designs").

In this analysis let's assume that we will be testing differences in status in the different cell types separately. For example, we want to know which genes are differentially expressed between pregnant and lactating in basal cells only. We have previously coded the `group` variable, which is a concatenation of cell type and status. Coding the cell type and status in this way allows us to be flexible in specifying which comparisons we are interested in.

```{r}
# Look at group variable again
group
# Specify a design matrix without an intercept term
design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + group)
design
## Make the column names of the design matrix a bit nicer
colnames(design) <- levels(group)
design
```

Each column of the design matrix tells us which samples correspond to each group. The samples which come from basal cells from a lactating mouse correspond to columns 5 and 6 in the counts matrix, i.e. the samples which have 1s.

## Voom transform the data

Once we have our design matrix ready to go, we can perform our voom transformation. Voom will automatically adjust the library sizes using the `norm.factors` already calculated. The voom transformation uses the experiment design matrix, and produces an `EList` object. We can add `plot=TRUE` to generate a plot of the mean-variance trend. This plot can also tell us if there are any genes that look really variable in our data, and if we've filtered the low counts adequately.

```{r voom-plot}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
v <- voom(y,design,plot = TRUE)
```

The voom normalised log2 counts can be found in v$E.
Take a look at what is in the voom object.

```{r}
v
# What is contained in this object?
names(v)
```

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> 1. What is in the `targets` slot of `v` and what does it correspond to in `y`?
> 1. What are the dimensions of the `weights` slot in `v`?
>

We can repeat the box plots for the normalised data to compare to before normalisation. The expression values in `v$E` are already log2 values so we don't need to log-transform.

```{r boxplots-beforeVsafter-TMM, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(logcounts, xlab="", ylab="Log2 counts per million",las=2,main="Unnormalised logCPM")
## Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median logCPM
abline(h=median(logcounts),col="blue")
boxplot(v$E, xlab="", ylab="Log2 counts per million",las=2,main="Voom transformed logCPM")
## Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median logCPM
abline(h=median(v$E),col="blue")
```

Compare these box plots to the box plots we generated before performing the normalisation. Can you see any differences?

### Testing for differential expression

Now that we have the voom transformed data we can use *limma* to test for differential expression. First we fit a linear model for each gene using the `lmFit` function in *limma*. `lmFit` needs the voom object and the design matrix that we have already specified, which is stored within the voom object.

```{r}
# Fit the linear model
fit <- lmFit(v)
names(fit)
```

`lmFit` estimates group means according to the design matrix, as well as gene-wise variances. There are a number of items stored in the `fit` object, most of which are specific to the statistical testing, and we won't be discussing these in detail today.

Since we are interested in differences between groups, we need to specify which comparisons we want to test. The comparison of interest can be specified using the `makeContrasts` function. Here, we are interested in knowing which genes are differentially expressed between the pregnant and lactating group in the basal cells. This is done by defining the null hypothesis as basal.pregnant - basal.lactate = 0 for each gene. Note that the group names must exactly match the column names of the design matrix.

```{r}
cont.matrix <- makeContrasts(B.PregVsLac=basal.pregnant - basal.lactate,levels=design)
```

Take a look at the contrast matrix. The contrast matrix tells *limma* which columns of the design matrix we are interested in testing our comparison. Note that here we have specified only one comparison to test, but we can specify as many as we want in one go.

```{r}
cont.matrix
```

Now we can apply the contrasts matrix to the `fit` object to get the statistics and estimated parameters of our comparison that we are interested in. Here we call the `contrasts.fit` function in *limma*.

```{r}
fit.cont <- contrasts.fit(fit, cont.matrix)
```

The final step is to call the `eBayes` function, which performs empirical Bayes shrinkage on the variances, and estimates moderated t-statistics and the associated p-values.

```{r}
fit.cont <- eBayes(fit.cont)
```

Check the dimensions of the fit object

```{r}
dim(fit.cont)
```

We can use the *limma* `decideTests` function to generate a quick summary of DE genes for the contrasts.

```{r}
summa.fit <- decideTests(fit.cont)
summary(summa.fit)
```

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> 1. Add another contrast to the contrasts matrix: `L.PregVsLac = luminal.pregnant - luminal.lactate` and re-run the code above. You should have two comparisons in `fit.cont` now.
> 1. Check out the `vennDiagram` function
> (HINT: type `?vennDiagram`).
> Can you show the overlap of differentially expressed genes between the two comparisons? How many genes are commonly differentially expressed?
>

**Solution**
```{r vennDiagram, echo=FALSE}
# Solution
cont.matrix <- makeContrasts(B.PregVsLac=basal.pregnant - basal.lactate,
                             L.PregVsLac=luminal.pregnant - luminal.lactate,
                             levels=design)
fit.cont <- contrasts.fit(fit, cont.matrix)
fit.cont <- eBayes(fit.cont)
summa.fit <- decideTests(fit.cont)
summary(summa.fit)

# Venn diagram
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
vennDiagram(summa.fit,include=c("up", "down"),counts.col=c("purple", "black"),
    circle.col = c("blue", "green3"))
```


The *limma* `topTable` function summarises the output in a table format. Significant DE genes for a particular comparison can be identified by selecting genes with a p-value smaller than a chosen cut-off value and/or a fold change greater than a chosen value in this table. By default the table will be sorted by the B statistic, which is the log-odds of differential expression. Usually the B statistic and p-value ranking will be the same, but this is not always the case. We will explicitly rank by p-value, which we can specify with the `sort.by` argument.

The `topTable` command will always output the top 10 genes by default, even if they are not statistically significant. We can specify the coefficient we are interested in by the name we used in the contrast matrix ("B.PregVsLac"), or by the column number.

```{r}
topTable(fit.cont,coef="B.PregVsLac",sort.by="p")
## This will give the same output
topTable(fit.cont,coef=1,sort.by="p")
```

## Adding annotation and saving the results

We have a list of significantly differentially expressed genes, but the only annotation we can see is the Entrez Gene ID, which is not very informative. We would like to add some annotation information. There are a number of ways to do this. We will demonstrate how to do this using the *org.Mm.eg.db* package.

First we need to decide what information we want. In order to see what we can extract we can run the `columns` function on the annotation database.

```{r}
columns(org.Mm.eg.db)
```

We definitely want gene symbols and perhaps the full gene name. Let's build up our annotation information in a separate data frame using the `select` function.

```{r}
ann <- select(org.Mm.eg.db,keys=rownames(fit.cont),columns=c("ENTREZID","SYMBOL","GENENAME"))
# Have a look at the annotation
head(ann)
```

Let's double check that the `ENTREZID` column matches exactly to our `fit.cont` rownames.

```{r}
table(ann$ENTREZID==rownames(fit.cont))
```

We can slot in the annotation information into the `genes` slot of `fit.cont`. (Please note that if the `select` function returns a 1:many mapping then you can't just append the annotation to the fit object. An alternative way to get annotation will be discussed tomorrow during the analysis of the second dataset.)

```{r}
fit.cont$genes <- ann
```

Now when we run the `topTable` command, the annotation information should be included in the output.

```{r}
topTable(fit.cont,coef="B.PregVsLac",sort.by="p")
```

To get the full table (i.e. the information for all genes, not just the top 10) we can specify `n="Inf"`.

```{r}
limma.res <- topTable(fit.cont,coef="B.PregVsLac",sort.by="p",n="Inf")
```

We can save the results table using the `write.csv` function, which writes the results out to a csv file, which you can open in excel.

```{r}
write.csv(limma.res,file="B.PregVsLacResults.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```

**A note about deciding how many genes are significant**: In order to decide which genes are differentially expressed, we usually take a cut-off of 0.05 on the adjusted p-value, NOT the raw p-value. This is because we are testing more than 15000 genes, and the chances of finding differentially expressed genes is very high when you do that many tests. Hence we need to control the false discovery rate, which is the adjusted p-value column in the results table. What this means is that if 100 genes are significant at a 5\% false discovery rate, we are willing to accept that 5 will be false positives. Note that the `decideTests` function displays significant genes at 5\% FDR.

# Plots after testing for DE

Let's do a few plots to make sure everything looks good and that we haven't made a mistake in the analysis. Genome-wide plots that are useful for checking are MAplots (or MDplots) and volcano plots. There are functions in limma for plotting these with `fit.cont` as input.

```{r plots-postDE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# We want to highlight the significant genes. We can get this from decideTests.
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(fit.cont,coef=1,status=summa.fit[,"B.PregVsLac"], values = c(-1, 1))

# For the volcano plot we have to specify how many of the top genes to highlight.
# We can also specify that we want to plot the gene symbol for the highlighted genes.
# let's highlight the top 100 most DE genes
volcanoplot(fit.cont,coef=1,highlight=100,names=fit.cont$genes$SYMBOL)
```

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> Look at the MD plot and volcano plot for the second comparison, `L.PregVsLac`. Change the number of highlighted genes to 200 in the volcano plot.
>

```{r plots-postDE-solution, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(fit.cont,coef=2,status=summa.fit[,"L.PregVsLac"], values=c(-1, 1))
volcanoplot(fit.cont,coef=2,highlight=200,names=fit.cont$genes$SYMBOL)
```


Before following up on the DE genes with further lab work, it is recommended to have a look at the expression levels of the individual samples for the genes of interest. We can quickly look at grouped expression using `stripchart`. We can use the normalised log expression values in the voom object (`v$E`).

```{r stripcharts, fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# Let's look at the first gene in the topTable, Wif1, which has a rowname 24117
stripchart(v$E["24117",]~group)
# This plot is ugly, let's make it better
stripchart(v$E["24117",]~group,vertical=TRUE,las=2,cex.axis=0.8,pch=16,col=1:6,method="jitter")
# Let's use nicer colours
nice.col <- brewer.pal(6,name="Dark2")
stripchart(v$E["24117",]~group,vertical=TRUE,las=2,cex.axis=0.8,pch=16,cex=1.3,col=nice.col,method="jitter",ylab="Normalised log2 expression",main="Wif1")
```

Notice anything interesting about the expression of this gene?

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> Take the top gene from the L.PregVsLactate comparison and make a stripchart of grouped expression as above. (Don't forget to change the title of the plot.)
>

**Solution**
```{r stripcharts-solution, echo=FALSE}
# Solution
topTable(fit.cont,coef=2,sort.by="p")
stripchart(v$E["12992",]~group,vertical=TRUE,las=2,cex.axis=0.8,pch=16,cex=1.3,col=nice.col,method="jitter",ylab="Normalised log2 expression",main="Csn1s2b")
```

An interactive version of the volcano plot above that includes the raw per sample values in a separate panel is possible via the `glXYPlot` function in the *Glimma* package.


```{r}
group2 <- group
levels(group2) <- c("basal.lactate","basal.preg","basal.virgin","lum.lactate", "lum.preg", "lum.virgin")
glXYPlot(x=fit.cont$coefficients[,1], y=fit.cont$lods[,1],
         xlab="logFC", ylab="B", main="B.PregVsLac",
         counts=y$counts, groups=group2, status=summa.fit[,1],
         anno=fit.cont$genes, side.main="ENTREZID", folder="volcano")
```


This function creates an html page (./volcano/XY-Plot.html) with a volcano plot on the left and a plot showing the log-CPM per sample for a selected gene on the right. A search bar is available to search for genes of interest.


# Testing relative to a threshold (TREAT)

When there is a lot of differential expression, sometimes we may want to cut-off on a fold change threshold as well as a p-value threshold so that we follow up on the most biologically significant genes. However, it is not recommended to simply rank by p-value and then discard genes with small logFC's, as this has been shown to increase the false discovery rate. In other words, you are not controlling the false discovery rate at 5\% any more. There is a function called `treat` in the *limma* package that performs this style of analysis correctly [@McCarthy2009]. `treat` will simply take our `fit.cont` object, as well as a user-specified log fold change cut-off, and recalculate the moderated t-statistics and p-values with the new information about logFC.

```{r MDplots-TREAT}
# Let's decide that we are only interested in genes that have a absolute logFC of 1.
# This corresponds to a fold change of 2, or 0.5 (i.e. double or half).
# We can perform a treat analysis which ranks our genes according to p-value AND logFC.
# This is easy to do after our analysis, we just give the treat function the fit.cont object and specify our cut-off.
fit.treat <- treat(fit.cont,lfc=1)
res.treat <- decideTests(fit.treat)
summary(res.treat)
topTable(fit.treat,coef=1,sort.by="p")
# Notice that much fewer genes are highlighted in the MAplot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMD(fit.treat,coef=1,status=res.treat[,"B.PregVsLac"], values=c(-1,1))
abline(h=0,col="grey")
plotMD(fit.treat,coef=2,status=res.treat[,"L.PregVsLac"], values=c(-1,1))
abline(h=0,col="grey")
```

> ### Challenge {.challenge}

**Solution**
```{r, echo=FALSE}

fit.treat <- treat(fit.cont,lfc=cutoff)
res.treat <- decideTests(fit.treat)
summary(res.treat)

```


An interactive version of the mean-difference plots is possible via the `glMDPlot` function in the *Glimma* package.

```{r}
glMDPlot(fit.treat, coef=1, counts=y$counts, groups=group2,
        status=res.treat, side.main="ENTREZID", main="B.PregVsLac",

```


As with the volcano plot example above, this function creates an html page (./md/MD-Plot.html) that allows the user to search for their favourite gene.


# Gene Set Testing

Sometimes there is quite a long list of differentially expressed genes to interpret after a differential expression analysis, and it is usually infeasible to go through the list one gene at a time trying to understand it's biological function. A common downstream procedure is gene set testing, which aims to understand which pathways/gene networks the differentially expressed genes are implicated in.

There are a number of different ways to go about testing for enrichment of biological pathways, and the test you choose usually depends on the question you're asking. There are two kinds of tests: self-contained and competitive gene set tests. Self-contained tests, which include the `ROAST` procedure, ask the question "Are the genes in the set/pathway differentially expressed as a whole?" Competitive gene set tests, like `goana` and `camera` ask the question whether the differentially expressed genes tend to be over-represented in the gene set, compared to all the other genes in the experiment. These different questions use different statistical methodology.


## Gene ontology testing with goana

First, we will perform a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the `goana` function in *limma*. There are approximately 20,000 GO terms, and they are split into three categories: BP (biological process), MF (molecular function) and CC (cellular component). `goana` uses annotation from the appropriate Bioconductor package and can be used for any of the five species specified (Hs, Mm, Rn, Dm or Pt). `goana` has an advantage over other methods, such as DAVID, in that there is the option to take into account the gene length bias inherent in RNA-Seq data.

Suppose we want to identify GO terms that are over-represented in the basal lactating group compared to the basal pregnancy group. This can be achieved by applying the goana function to the differential expression results of that comparison. `goana` takes the `fit.cont` object, the coefficient of interest and the species. The top set of most enriched GO terms can be viewed with the topGO function.

```{r}
go <- goana(fit.cont, coef="B.PregVsLac",species = "Mm")
topGO(go, n=10)
```

The row names of the output are the universal identifiers of the GO terms, with one term per row. The Term column gives the names of the GO terms. These terms cover three domains - biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF), as shown in the Ont column. The N column represents the total number of genes that are annotated with each GO term. The Up and Down columns represent the number of differentially expressed genes that overlap with the genes in the GO term. The P.Up and P.Down columns contain the p-values for over-representation of the GO term across the set of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. The output table is sorted by the minimum of P.Up and P.Down by default.

An additional refinement is to supply `goana` with the gene lengths using the `covariate` argument. In the original data matrix that we loaded into R, there is a column called "Length".

```{r}
colnames(seqdata)
```

In order to get the gene lengths for every gene in `fit.cont`, we can use the `match` command. Note that the gene length supplied needs to be in the correct order.

```{r}
m <- match(rownames(fit.cont),seqdata$EntrezGeneID)
gene_length <- seqdata$Length[m]
head(gene_length)
# Rerun goana with gene length information
go_length <- goana(fit.cont,coef="B.PregVsLac",species="Mm",
                   covariate=gene_length)
topGO(go_length, n=10)
```

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> Perform GO analysis for the second comparison, "L.PregVsLac", taking into account gene length information
>

**Solution**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
go_LPregvsLac <- goana(fit.cont,coef="L.PregVsLac",species="Mm",
                       covariate=gene_length)
topGO(go_LPregvsLac, n=10)
```


Notes

* Users can specify the domain of the enriched GO terms in topGO. For instance, topGO(go,ontology="BP") lists the top set of most enriched GO terms that are related to a biological process. This avoids other domains that are not of interest.
* The goana function uses the NCBI RefSeq annotation. Therefore, the Entrez Gene identifier (ID) should be supplied for each gene as the row names of the fit object.
* Users should set species according to the organism being studied.

## CAMERA gene set testing using the Broad's curated gene sets

Other databases of gene sets that are available come from the Broad Institute's Molecular Signatures Database ([MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb)). CAMERA is good option for testing a very large number of gene sets such as the MSigDB sets, as it is very fast. CAMERA is known as a competitive gene set test, however it has the advantage that it can take into account inter-gene correlation within each gene set [@wu2012camera]. It also works seamlessly with a `voom` object, taking into account the mean-variance relationship in RNA-Seq data.

Here we will be using the C2 gene sets for mouse, available as .rdata files from the WEHI bioinformatics page [http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/index.html](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/index.html). The C2 gene sets contain 4725 curated gene sets collected from a variety of places: BioCarta, KEGG, Pathway Interaction Database, Reactome as well as some published studies.It doesn't include GO terms.

```{r}
# Load in the mouse c2 gene sets
# The R object is called Mm.c2
load("data/mouse_c2_v5.rdata")
# Have a look at the first few gene sets
names(Mm.c2)[1:5]
# Number of gene sets in C2
length(Mm.c2)
```

The gene identifiers are Entrez Gene ID, which is the same as the rownames of our voom object. We need to map the Entrez gene ids between the list of gene sets and our voom object. We can do this using the `ids2indices` function.

```{r}
c2.ind <- ids2indices(Mm.c2, rownames(v))
```

CAMERA takes as input the voom object `v`, the indexed list of gene sets `c2.ind`, the design matrix, the contrast being tested, as well as some other arguments. By default, CAMERA can estimate the correlation for each gene set separately. However, in practise, it works well to set a small inter-gene correlation of about 0.05 using the `inter.gene.cor` argument.

```{r}
gst.camera <- camera(v,index=c2.ind,design=design,contrast = cont.matrix[,1],inter.gene.cor=0.05)
```

CAMERA outputs a dataframe of the resulting statistics, with each row denoting a different gene set. The output is ordered by p-value so that the most significant should be at the top. Let's look at the top 5 gene sets:

```{r}
gst.camera[1:5,]
```

The total number of significant gene sets at 5\% FDR is

```{r}
table(gst.camera$FDR < 0.05)
```

You can write out the camera results to a csv file to open in excel.

```{r}
write.csv(gst.camera,file="gst_BPregVsLac.csv")
```

**Solution**
```{r, echo=FALSE}

table(H.camera$FDR < 0.05)
H.camera[1:10,]
```


## ROAST gene set testing

ROAST is an example of a self-contained gene set test [@wu2010roast]. It asks the question, "Do the genes in my set tend to be differentially expressed between my conditions of interest?". ROAST doesn't care about what the other genes in the experiment are doing, which is different to `camera` and `goana`. ROAST is a good option for when you're interested in a specific set, or a few sets. It is not really used to test thousands of sets at one time.

From the Hallmark gene sets, two MYC pathways were most significant.

```{r}
H.camera[1:10,]
```

Let's see if there are any MYC signalling pathways in MsigDB C2 collection. We can do this with the `grep` command on the names of the gene sets.

```{r}
grep("MYC_",names(c2.ind))
# Let's save these so that we can subset c2.ind to test all gene sets with MYC in the name
myc <- grep("MYC_",names(c2.ind))
# What are these pathways called?
names(c2.ind)[myc]
```

Let's use ROAST to see if these MYC related gene sets tend to be differentially expressed. Note that the syntax for `camera` and `roast` is almost identical.

```{r}
myc.rst <- roast(v,index=c2.ind[myc],design=design,contrast=cont.matrix[,1],nrot=999)
myc.rst[1:15,]
```

Each row corresponds to a single gene set. The NGenes column gives the number of genes in each set. The PropDown and PropUp columns contain the proportions of genes in the set that are down- and up-regulated, respectively, with absolute fold changes greater than 2. The net direction of change is determined from the significance of changes in each direction, and is shown in the Direction column. The PValue provides evidence for whether the majority of genes in the set are DE in the specified direction, whereas the PValue.Mixed tests for differential expression in any direction. FDRs are computed from the corresponding p-values across all sets.

> ### Challenge {.challenge}
>
> 1. Test whether the MYC signalling pathways tend to be differentially expressed between luminal pregnant vs lactating (the second contrast).
> 1. Look for gene sets containing "WNT" in the name and see whether they tend to be differentially expressed in basal pregnant vs lactating.
>

**Solution**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Solution 1
myc.rst2 <- roast(v,index=c2.ind[myc],design=design,contrast=cont.matrix[,2],nrot=999)
myc.rst2[1:15,]

#Solution 2
wnt <- grep("WNT",names(c2.ind))
wnt.rst <- roast(v,index=c2.ind[wnt],design=design,contrast=cont.matrix[,1],nrot=999)
wnt.rst[1:15,]
```


Notes

* A common application of ROAST is to use a set of DE genes that was defined from an analysis of an independent data set. ROAST can then determine whether similar changes are observed in the contrast of interest for the current data set.
* Even for GO-defined gene sets, goana and ROAST have different behaviours. In goana, the significance of differential expression for a GO term is determined relative to other DE genes that are not annotated with that term. In ROAST, only differential expression for the genes in the set are relevant to the significance of that set and its corresponding term. goana depends on a significance cutoff to choose DE genes, whereas ROAST does not require a cutoff and evaluates all genes in the set.
* ROAST estimates p-values by simulation, so the results may change slightly between runs. More precise p-values can be obtained by increasing the number of rotations, albeit at the cost of increased computational time.
* The smallest p-value that can be reported is 1/(2nrot + 1) where nrot is the number of rotations. This lower bound can be decreased by increasing nrot.

## Visualising gene set tests: Barcode and enrichment plots

A barcode plot can be produced with the `barcodeplot` function to visualize the results for any particular set. To display a barcodeplot, we need to decide what statistics to use, usually we choose either logFC or t-statistics for the comparison of interest. We also need to make sure we give the statistics in the correct order, such that subsetting the statistics vector will give the genes for the gene set we're interested in. The best way to do this is to work with the fit object directly. The `coefficients` slot contains the logFCs and the `t` slot contains the t-statistics.

Let's have a look at one of the top MYC related pathway in the ROAST test that you have already done, "MENSSEN_MYC_TARGETS".

```{r barcodeplots}
# Have a look at the logFCs and t-statistics in fit.cont
names(fit.cont)
head(fit.cont$coefficients)
head(fit.cont$t)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
# barcode plot with logFCs
barcodeplot(fit.cont$coeff[,1], index=c2.ind[["MENSSEN_MYC_TARGETS"]], main="LogFC: MENSSEN_MYC_TARGETS")
# barcode plot using t-statistics
barcodeplot(fit.cont$t[,1], index=c2.ind[["MENSSEN_MYC_TARGETS"]], main="T-statistic: MENSSEN_MYC_TARGETS")
```

Here, genes are represented by bars and are ranked from left to right by decreasing log-fold change or t-statistic. This forms the barcode-like pattern. The line above the barcode shows the relative local enrichment of the vertical bars in each part of the plot. The barcodeplot shows that the genes in this gene set tend to be up-regulated between pregnant and lactating in basal cells.
